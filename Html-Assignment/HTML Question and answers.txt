	XHTML: XHTML follows stricter XML syntax rules. All elements must be properly nested, and all tags must be closed, 
	even self-closing tags like <br /> and <img />. XHTML requires well-formed markup, meaning that elements must be closed in the 
	correct order, and attribute values must be enclosed in double quotes.

21) What are logical and physical tags in HTML?
==> In HTML, there is no strict distinction between "logical tags" and "physical tags." However, there is a concept related 
	to HTML tags called "semantic tags" and "presentational tags," which can be somewhat related to the idea of logical and physical tags.

	Semantic Tags (Logical Tags):
		Semantic tags are HTML elements that convey meaning about the structure and content of the web page. 
		They describe the purpose of the content they enclose, making the page more accessible and understandable for both 
		humans and search engines. Semantic tags include:

		<header>: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
		<nav>: Defines a section with navigation links.
		<article>: Represents a self-contained composition, such as a blog post or news article.
		<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
		<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
		<footer>: Represents the footer of a section or a page.

	Presentational Tags (Physical Tags):
		Presentational tags are HTML elements that were historically used to control the visual appearance of web content but 
		are now considered outdated and deprecated. Examples of presentational tags include <font>, <b>, <i>, <u>, and <strike>. 
		These tags specify how text should be formatted (such as bold or italic) and are often referred to as "physical" because 
		they focus on the visual presentation rather than the content's meaning.
